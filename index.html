<p style="font-size:20px";> MS Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (present-day Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devki Devi. His paternal village is in the Lamgara block in Almora, Uttarakhand. His father, Pan Singh, moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi and worked in junior management positions in MECON. Dhoni has a sister and a brother-- Jayanti Gupta (sister) and Narendra Singh Dhoni (Brother). Dhoni did his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Ranchi, Jharkhand and excelled in multiple sports such as badminton, football and cricket. He played as a goalkeeper for his football team and played cricket for a local club. 

Dhoni showed impressive wicket-keeping skills at the Commando Cricket Club during 1995-98 and was picked up for Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship for the 1997-98 session and played well. After completing High School, Dhoni focussed on Cricket. 

During 2001-2003, Dhoni was a TTE (Travelling Ticket Examiner) at Kharagpur Railway Station, under South Eastern Railway in West Bengal. </p>

<p style="font-size:20px";>MS Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He is famously known for his lower-order attacking mode which he later changed due to his responsibility as a captain. He is also one of the fastest running men between the wickets. His Helicopter Shot technique is loved by all which was taught to him by his fellow player childhood friend Santosh Lal. 

Apart from batting, he is widely appreciated for his wicket-keeping skills by several experts of the game. He is the quickest wicket-keeper when it comes to stumpings. He holds a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper. He sometimes bowls as a medium-fast bowler for the Indian Cricket team.  </p>
